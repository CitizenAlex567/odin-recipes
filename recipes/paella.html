        <h1>Paella's recipe</h1>
        <img src="goya-shrimp-paella.jpg">
        <p>The Spanish can be quite protective about what is and what isn’t a paella, but at the same time, the spirit of their cooking has always been flexible to whatever meat, fish, seafood or game can be found.</p>
       
        <ul>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 carrot</li>
            <li>70g quality chroizo</li>
            <li>½ a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley (15g)</li>
            <li>2 free-range chicken thighs, skin off, bone out</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sweet smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 red pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato purée</li>
            <li>1 organic chicken stock cube</li>
            <li>300g paella rice</li>
            <li>100g frozen peas</li>
            <li>200g frozen peeled cooked prawns, from sustainable sources</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
        </ul>
      
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and finely slice the garlic, peel and roughly chop the onion and carrot. Finely chop the parsley stalks, then roughly chop the chorizo and chicken thighs</li>
            <li>Put a lug of oil into a large lidded shallow casserole or paella pan on a medium heat, add the garlic, onion, carrot, parsley stalks, chorizo, chicken and paprika, and fry for around 5 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
            <li>Deseed and chop the pepper, then add to the pan for a further 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir through the tomato purée and crumble in the stock cube, then add the rice and stir for a couple of minutes so it starts to suck up all that lovely flavour.</li>
            <li>Pour in 750ml of boiling water and add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Pop the lid on and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 15 minutes, stirring regularly from the outside in and from the inside out, and adding a splash of water if needed.</li>
            <li>Stir in the peas and prawns, replace the lid, and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until hot through.</li>
            <li>Season to perfection, then chop the parsley leaves, scatter them over the paella, and serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over.</li>
        </ol>
